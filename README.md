# Legion .NET

Classic Amiga game - Legion - rewritten in C# language, based on the official AMOS source code provided by authors. 

Multiplatform in mind, but currently focused on Windows. 

Polish and English languages, but should be possible to add more later.

## Original source code
Original source code and files can be found in /original folder

## Techonology stack
MonoGame on .Net 6.

## Issues derived from original version
- [ ] cloning items when putting them on the ground and loading game after that (items on the ground will stay on the same place)
- [ ] characters path finding is poor
